Toolbox and related resources used to analyze LINCS data
=====

Based on the work of [l1ktools](https://github.com/cmap/l1ktools), we implement our own code to analyze the LINCS data. The repository mainly contain following catalogs.

data extraction
--------
Similar to the [c3](http://support.lincscloud.org/hc/en-us/articles/202672498-Workshop) of lincsclould, we implement similar functions for our own purpose.

gene expression signature comparison
--------
API used to compare gene expression signatures. Metrics include GSEA, Spearman rank correlation, RRHO...  

web
--------
Code for web visualization.

miscellaneous
--------
R code used to compare the similarities of different cell lines of a given gene for trt_sh data.
R code used to compare the similarities of a drug and all other drugs.
